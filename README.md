# Easy security maps

This repository contains set of mindmaps and links helping students to obtain SOC-related knowledge as well as expirience with open-source and proprietary tools. 
We suggest to use ready virtual machines and distributions listed below:
1. [FLARE VM](https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm/blob/master/README.md)
1. [REMnux](https://remnux.org)
1. [SIFT Workstation](https://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/downloads)

## Mind maps
1. [Email Analysis](#Email-analysis)
1. [MS Office Files Analysis](#MS-Office-Files-Analysis)

### Email analysis

This mindmap shows what types of IOCs could be executed from suspicious email headers, content and attached files:
- string
- hash
- IP-address
- domain name
- host name

### MS Office Files Analysis

There is a list of open-source tools grouped by actions which can be executed with suspicious MS Office files (doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx etc.)
